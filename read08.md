## Loops
* **For** If you need to run code a specific number of times, use for loop. (it is the most common loop.) In a **for** loop, the condition is usually a counter which is used to how many time the loop should run.
~~~ JavaScript
for (var i = 0; i <10; i++){
	document.write(i); 
	}
~~~
* **While** If you don't know how many times the code should run, you can use **while** loop, Here the condition can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is **true**.
~~~JavaScript
while (i<10) {
msg += i + ' x 5 = ' + (i * 5) + '<br />';
i++;
}
~~~

## operators
A **logical operator** is a symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions such that the value of the compound expression produced depends only on that of the original expressions and on the meaning of the operator. Common logical operators include AND, OR, and NOT.
JavaScript
