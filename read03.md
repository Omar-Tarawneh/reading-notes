Briefly **Git** is an open source software that allow you to dear with file with a very productive way using the _**Terminal**_.
you will use a certain command that allow you to copy, save and update you code. 
Here is some command we use today:
* git clone "link address" , get a copy of a code in your computer
* git add . 	,stage your change
* git commit -m "message", save your change and are ready to be pushed to **Github**
* git status , see the file you modified 
## HTML
we learn about _**semantic**_ tags and how we structure our code accordingly to the flow of these **tags** 
![wiframe](https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_sem_elements.gif)
semantic tags have function to do in the web site it's just help you to navigate between different side of your **web page**.
Here an code example:
```
