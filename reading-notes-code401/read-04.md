## TDD Advantages

- Better program design and higher code quality. ...
- Detailed project documentation. ...
- TDD reduces the time required for project development.

## beforeEach & afterEach

While writing tests you have some setup work that needs to happen before tests run, and you have some finishing work that needs to happen after tests run.

## TDD disadvantage

- slow process of development
- All the members of a team got to do it
- Tests got to be maintained when requirements change

## ES6 Classes Vs Constructor/Prototype Classes

ES6 Classes are more simpler and easy to maintained, inheritance is much more efficient than Constructor.

## Why REST?

Actually I don't like REST, **Graphql** is much more efficient and easy to deal with, and I'm currently learning **Graphql** to use.
but REST is fine too.

## Table of definition

- functional programming: programming style where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.
- OOP: is a programming style based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code.
- super: t is used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods
- this: refers to the object it belongs to. In a function, this refers to the global object. In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined . In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
- Test Driven Development (TDD): is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
- Jest: is a node.js framework mainly used with TDD and make tests.
- Continuous Integration (CI): is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.
- REST: is an application programming interface, set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software.
- Data Model: is the style or the way of how you organized your files and code and how they are related together.

## Preview

- SQL vs noSQL
  - sql databases mainly are relational databases
  - nosql are distributed databases- have no relation.
  - sql have predefined schema structured data
  - nosql are dynamic for unstructured data
  - sql databases use **SQL** language.
  - NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents

## noSQL modeling & moongose

- It is an Object Data Modeling library for MongoDB and Node. js.
- Example of noSQL model:
  - Key-Value storage is a very simplistic
  - Ordered Key-Value model which is the most powerful model
