## World Cases to Change

- Authentication
- Error Handling
- Data Modelling

## Route Handler is Middleware

False

## Middleware Ended the process

you can by throwing and error or you cant but a condition and not calling the next function

## Injecting the Middleware

the middleware is active when send a request and before calling the handler of the route - the callback function.

## Express Error

Calling the callback function twice, throwing an error before the response.

## Terms and definition

- Middleware
  function that process some data which is be called before the handler

- Request Object
  The req **object** represents the HTTP **request** and has properties for the **request** query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on.

- Response Object
  The res **object** represents the HTTP **response** that an **Express** app sends when it gets an HTTP request.
- Application Middleware
  Middleware that plays a role in the function of the application.

- Routing Middleware
  Middleware that plays a role in path routing.

- TDD
  **Test Driven Development (TDD)** is software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do.

- Behavioral Testing
  **Behavioural Testing** is a **testing** of the external **behaviour** of the program, also known as black box **testing**. It is usually a functional **testing**.

## Preparation Material

### Classes

Classes are a template for creating objects. contain a set of data and some method to deal with the data, and they are only available on **ES6**.

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
}
```

### Express Routing

_Routing_ refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.

```javascript
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('root');
});
```

**Route Handler**
You can provide multiple callback functions that behave like middleware to handle a request.
you can have middleware function runs before the route handler

```javascript
app.get(
  '/example/b',
  function (req, res, next) {
    console.log('the response will be sent by the next function ...');
    next();
  },
  function (req, res) {
    res.send('Hello from B!');
  }
);
```

## Using the Route in Express

There is a multiple way to do the routing in Express:
First way:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
// middleware
app.use((req,res,next) =>{
	console.log(req.path, req.method);
	next();
});

app.get('/', (req, res) =>{
	res.send('Hello world!');
}
```

Second way Using the Router:

```javascript
var router = express.Router();
router.use(function (req, res, next) {
  console.log(req.method, req.url);
  next();
});
router.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('im the home page!');
});
```
