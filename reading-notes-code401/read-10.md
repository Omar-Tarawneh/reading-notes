## Stack and Queues

**Stack** A stack is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted and deleted only from one side of the list, called the top.

A stack follows the LIFO (last In First Out)

Example: the element inserted at teh last is the first element to come out.

Insertion into stack called **push** operation.
Deletion from the stack claled **pop** operation.

the last element in the stack called top.

**Queue**: A queue is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted only from one side of the list called rear, and the elements can be deleted only from the other side called the front.

The queue data structure follows the FIFO (First In First Out).

Example: the element inserted at first in teh list, is the firs telement to be removed from the list.

insertion of an element in queue called an **enqueue** operation.
Deletion of an element is called a **dequeue** operation.

### Stack vs Qeueu

In stacks we maintain only one pointer to access the list

In queues we maintain two pointers to access the list

### Observation

Data structures are a very simple and powerful concept to learn about. They can help us improve our logical thinking, the way we structure and solve problems, and how we find the best solutions for specific use cases in our modern applications. Stacks and queues are two powerful solutions that can help us organize data into sequential order depending on what result we want to achieve and have efficient and fantastic performance.
