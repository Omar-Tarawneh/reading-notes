![node](https://coralogix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Coralogix-Nodejs-integration.jpg)

> Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

**The V8 engine** is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

## npm 'Node Package Manager'

**npm** originally short for **Node Package Manager** is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language.

##  What Is Node.js Used For?

Node.js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.
