## Call Stack

A **call stack** is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions.

Basically it will reorganize you code to run it probably.

#### Conclusion

The key takeaways from the call stack are:  
1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.  
2. Code execution is synchronous.  
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.  
4. It works as a LIFO â€” Last In, First Out data structure.
