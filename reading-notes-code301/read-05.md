Node.js is a platform built on [Chrome's JavaScript runtime](https://code.google.com/p/v8/) for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
