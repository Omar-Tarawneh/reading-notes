## Html Images

From previous lab we learn how we can control the element float left of right 
in this part we will learn:

* How to control images size 
* How to set images as background 
* Aligning Images using CSS

## Center the images 

This example will center the image in the center:

```css
img {  
display:  block;  
margin-left:  auto;  
margin-right:  auto;  
width:  50%;  
}

```
This will make the image responsive to size of the screen
If you set the values by pixels that will not be responsive.

## Set the image as background

simply using CSS you can use the ```background-image``` property to set images to some block or tag as background with some additional values to not or repeat and control the images axis (y, x),

```css 
body {  
background-image:  url("paper.gif");  
background-color:  #cccccc;  
}
```

## Practical information

### Search Engine optimization 

SEO means the process of improving your site to increase its visibility for relevant searches. The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to garner attention and attract prospective and existing customers to your business.
It's very important topic to increase the traffic in your website.

At the heart of SEO is the idea of working out which terms people are likely to enter into a search engine to find your site and then using these terms in the right places on your site to increase the chances that search engines will show a link to your site in their results.

### Domain Name 

Your domain name is your web address (e.g. google.com or bbc. co.uk). There are many websites that allow you to register domain names. Usually you will have to pay an annual fee to keep that domain name.

### Web Hosting

So that other people can see your site, you will need to upload it to a web server. Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet. They are specially set up to serve web pages when they are requested.
