### JavaScript Function, Method and object

we use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.
JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
A JavaScript **method** is a property containing a **function definition**.

**Access object method example**

```Javascript
objectName.methodName()
```

There is also another type called the **Built-in Method**

```Javascript
var x = message.toUpperCase();
```
