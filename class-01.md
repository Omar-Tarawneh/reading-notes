## The ABC of Programming

Computers solve problems programmatically; they follow series of instructions, one after another. The type of instructions they need are often different to the type of instructions you might give to another human. Therefore, throughout the book you will not only learn the vocabulary and syntax that JavaScript uses, but you will also learn how to write instructions that computers can follow. For example, when you look at the picture on the left how do you tell which person is the tallest? A computer would need explicit, step-by-step instructi0ns, such as:

1. Find the height of the first person
2. Assume he or she is the "tallest person"
3. Look at the height of the remaining people oneby-one and compare their height to the "tallest person" you have found so far
4. At each step, if you find someone whose height is greater than the current "tallest person", he or she becomes the new "tallest person"
5. Once you have checked all the people, tell me which one is the tallest So the computer needs to look at each person in turn, and for each one it performs a test ("Are they taller than the current tallest person?"). Once it has done this for each person it can give its answer.

## JavaScript

_A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal._

- JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.

- JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.

- JavaScript is easy to learn.

```JavaScript
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits.toString();
<script>
var  d =  new  Date();
d.setFullYear(2020,  11,  3);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML  = d;
</script>
```
